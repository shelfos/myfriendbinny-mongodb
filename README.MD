# Overview

MyFriendBinny is a program for tracking storage bin inventory and the items stored in those bins.  This is the second version and is meant to be run in a console (just like the first), but the difference is that this version uses a Cloud database - specifically MongoDB.  The GUI is the same as in the first version (very basic console), but it includes a login screen so that the user can connect to the MongoDB database.  Later versions will include a web application and mobile app, and will allow you to label your bins with a QR code, as well as attach images of all the objects in your bins.

# Cloud Database


# Development Environment

- Windows
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA with Gradle.  Because of some of the features (specifically serialization/JSON), I used Gradle for building the project.
- Kotlin language (and some Java libraries)
- Powershell as my console for running the program

# Programming languages and libraries
- Kotlin: kotlin.io.path.Path, kotlin.io.path.createDirectories, kotlinx.serialization.*, kotlinx.serialization.json.*
- Java: java.util.*, java.io.File

# Future Work

- Convert to a mobile app (start with Android)
- Use relational database to track inventory
- Include use of QR codes and item images
